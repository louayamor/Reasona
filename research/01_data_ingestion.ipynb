      "# Thalassery Biryani\\n*   **Servings:** 4\\n*   **Prep time:** Approx. 1 hour\\n*   **Difficulty:** 3\\n*   **Energy:** Approx. 600-700 Cal per serving\\n\\n**Thalassery biriyani** is a rice dish blended with Chicken and Spices. The recipe has a strong legacy of the Mughlai cuisine. This variant of biryani is an Indian cuisine and has originated from the Malabar region of South India. The specialty is the difference in the choice of rice (Basmati rice is not used; small-grained Khaima/Jeerakasala rice is used); Chicken is not fried before adding to the masala. Thalassery biryani is a *Pakki biryani* where as Hyderabadi is a *Kacchi biryani* and therefore apparently a dum biryani. There are clear distinctions of taste between Thalassery biryani and other biryani variants.\\n\\n## Ingredients\\n\\n### Rice\\n\\n*   750 g (3 cups) khaima or jeerakasala rice\\n*   3 tbsp ghee\\n*   1 tsp dalda (vanaspati)\\n*   Cinnamon sticks, as needed\\n*   3–4 whole cloves\\n*   3–4 cardamom pods\\n*   ⅔ leaves Malabar leaf (Indian bay leaf)\\n*   ¼ tsp kaskas (Indian white poppy seeds)\\n*   ¾ pieces star anise (optional)\\n\\n### Masala\\n\\n*   ⅓ cup coconut oil\\n*   6 (500 g) finely-chopped onion\\n*   ¼ cup (approx. 50 g) cashew nuts\\n*   ¼ cup (approx. 50 g) kismis (sultana raisins)\\n*   1 pinch yellow/orange artificial food colour\\n*   1 tsp saffron, soaked in milk\\n*   5 medium tomatoes, chopped\\n*   2-inch piece fresh ginger, grated or cut into small pieces\\n*   1–1.5 cloves garlic, or to taste\\n*   6 green chiles, or to taste\\n*   5 shallots, or to taste\\n*   1 tsp fennel seeds\\n*   1 tsp cumin seeds\\n*   ½ tsp turmeric powder\\n*   3–4 pieces mace\\n*   1 tsp red chile powder\\n*   1 kg chicken, cut into slightly bigger pieces than usually used for curry, soaked 20 minutes in water and washed\\n*   3 tbsp lime juice\\n*   ½ tbsp garam masala powder\\n*   ¾–1 cup (approx. 1 bunch) coriander leaves, chopped\\n*   ¾–1 cup (approx. 1 bunch) pudina (mint) leaves, chopped\\n*   ½ tsp black pepper powder\\n*   Diluted yogurt, to taste\\n*   Table salt to taste\\n\\n### Assembly\\n\\n*   1 tbsp edible rose water\\n\\n## Procedure\\n\\n### Rice\\n\\n1.  Wash the rice in water, and drain completely.\\n2.  Heat the ghee and a small amount of dalda in a kadai. Add the drained rice and fry for a few minutes.\\n3.  Add water to the rice in a ratio of 1¾:1 water to rice.\\n4.  Add cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, bay leaf, Indian white poppy seeds, star anise, and lemon juice. Reduce to a simmer, cover the pan, and cook until all the water is absorbed.\\n\\n### Masala\\n\\n1.  Heat the coconut oil and a little ghee in a deep kadai. Add chopped onions, cashew nuts, and sultana raisins, then fry until it caramel in colour. Remove from the heat and set aside.\\n2.  Heat the chopped tomatoes and a little water in a deep kadai (do not add oil) until the tomatoes are softened.\\n3.  Add crushed ginger, garlic, chopped green chili, and chopped shallot. Stir until the raw smell fades.\\n4.  Stir in fennel seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, mace, and red chili powder.\\n5.  Mix in the chicken. Cover and cook, stirring intermittently to prevent sticking, until almost cooked.\\n6.  Add ¼ of the fried onion mixture, lemon juice, garam masala powder, chopped coriander leaves, and pudina (mint) leaves. Reduce to a simmer.\\n7.  Add black pepper powder and yogurt, and cook until the chicken and masala mixture blend together.\\n\\n### Assembly\\n\\n1.  Combine the rice, remaining onion mixture, artificial color, saffron milk, and rosewater.\\n2.  Layer the masala and rice in a dish, and cover with the lid, tightly sealing the lid with a maida dough or dishcloth.\\n3.  Place hot coals or charcoal on the lid while cooking. The flame need to be in a simmer mode in this stage of preparation.\\n4.  Serve.\\n\\n## Notes, tips, and variations\\n\\n*   The rice is different in Thalassery biryani. A small-grained, thin(not round), good aroma, variant of rice known as **Khaima/Jeerkasala** is used. Basmati rice is not used to make Thalassery biryani.\\n*   Khaima/Jeerakasala rice do not require Pre-soaking and Post-draining of water after preparation, like the usual rice varieties.\\n*   No oil is used for chicken base and chicken is not fried before adding to the masala.    1\n",
      "Controversies\\n\\nIn recent years, a number of gender and sexual controversies have surrounded the Cannes Film Festival. These include \"Heelgate\" in which numerous female attendees of a red carpet premiere were stopped from entering in 2015 for wearing flat soled shoes instead of high heels. The incident caused numerous female celebrities to wear flat soled shoes or no shoes at all to other red carpet premiers in a show of solidarity and protest.\\n\\nAs a result of the past sexual controversies and the # MeToo movement that arose out of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, in 2018, Cannes Film Festival officials announced the creation of a telephone hotline during the festival in which victims could report incidents of sexual harassment and other crimes. The hotline is in collaboration with the French government.\\n\\nGeneral Delegate Thierry Frémaux reportedly 'banned' selfies on the red carpet of the festival in 2015.\\n\\nIn 2017, along with the 70th anniversary events of the Festival, the issue of changing the rules on theatrical screening caused controversy. In 2018, the enforcement of theatrical screening in France resulted in Netflix withdrawing their films from the festival.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "Willem Barentsz (Dutch pronunciation:; c. 1550 – 20 June 1597), anglicized as William Barents or Barentz, was a Dutch navigator, cartographer, and Arctic explorer.\\n\\nBarentsz went on three expeditions to the far north in search for a Northeast passage. He reached as far as Novaya Zemlya and the Kara Sea in his first two voyages, but was turned back on both occasions by ice. During a third expedition, the crew discovered Spitsbergen and Bear Island, but subsequently became stranded on Novaya Zemlya for almost a year.

Industries encouraged in the zone include electronics assembly and manufacturing, telecommunications equipment, trading and distribution, automobile production/assembly, medical equipment and supplies, shipping/warehousing/logistics, and heavy industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "Urbanisation\\n\\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), the city needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thủ Thiêm city centre in District 2 and the Phú Mỹ Hưng Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australian Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phú Mỹ Hưng's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km (11.1 mi) 10–14 lane wide Nguyễn Văn Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tân Thuận Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phú Gia 99. Phú Mỹ Hưng's new City Centre received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "Optical sights\\n\\nIn some reticled optical instruments such as telescopes, microscopes or in telescopic sights (\"scopes\") used on small arms and theodolites, parallax can create problems when the reticle is not coincident with the focal plane of the target image. This is because when the reticle and the target are not at the same focus, the optically corresponded distances being projected through the eyepiece are also different, and the user's eye will register the difference in parallaxes between the reticle and the target (whenever eye position changes) as a relative displacement on top of each other. The term parallax shift refers to the resultant apparent \"floating\" movements of the reticle over the target image when the user moves his/her head/eye laterally (up/down or left/right) behind the sight, i.e. an error where the reticle does not stay aligned with the user's optical axis.\\n\\nSome firearm scopes are equipped with a parallax compensation mechanism, which consists of a movable optical element that enables the optical system to shift the focus of the target image at varying distances into the same optical plane of the reticle (or vice versa). Many low-tier telescopic sights may have no parallax compensation because in practice they can still perform very acceptably without eliminating parallax shift. In this case, the scope is often set fixed at a designated parallax-free distance that best suits their intended usage. Typical standard factory parallax-free distances for hunting scopes are 100 yd (or 90 m) to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300 yd/m. Some competition and military-style scopes without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300 yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at longer ranges. Scopes for guns with shorter practical ranges, such as airguns, rimfire rifles, shotguns, and muzzleloaders, will have parallax settings for shorter distances, commonly 50 m (55 yd) for rimfire scopes and 100 m (110 yd) for shotguns and muzzleloaders. Airgun scopes are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually in the form of an adjustable objective (or \"AO\" for short) design, and may adjust down to as near as 3 metres (3.3 yd).\\n\\nNon-magnifying reflector or \"reflex\" sights can be theoretically \"parallax free\". But since these sights use parallel collimated light this is only true when the target is at infinity. At finite distances, eye movement perpendicular to the device will cause parallax movement in the reticle image in exact relationship to the eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics. Firearm sights, such as some red dot sights, try to correct for this via not focusing the reticle at infinity, but instead at some finite distance, a designed target range where the reticle will show very little movement due to parallax. Some manufacturers market reflector sight models they call \"parallax free\", but this refers to an optical system that compensates for off axis spherical aberration, an optical error induced by the spherical mirror used in the sight that can cause the reticle position to diverge off the sight's optical axis with change in eye position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

Query Decomposition\\n\\n\"Basmati rice and frying chicken prior to adding it to the masala\" → user assumes these are traditional Thalassery biryani techniques\\n\"Thalassery biryani methods\" → specific regional variation from Kerala coast\\n\"dum cooking effect\" → pressure/steam cooking technique creating tender meat/rice\\n\\nKey issue: **premise error**. User conflates general biryani practices with Thalassery specificity.\\n\\n### 2. Traditional Thalassery Verification\\n\\n● **Rice variety**: Khaima/Jeerakasala rice, not Basmati\\n● **Chicken preparation**: No pre-frying before masala addition  \\n● **Cooking method**: *Pakki biryani* (cooked separately then layered), not *Kacchi* (raw meat layered)\\n\\n→ These distinguish Thalassery from other biryani variants\\n\\n### 3. Dum Effect Analysis\\n\\n\"Dum\" = pressure cooking with lid sealed\\nTraditional Thalassery:\\n- Layer rice/masala alternately\\n- Seal with maida dough/cloth + coal heating on top\\n- → Steam circulates, cooks bottom layer while keeping top moist\\n- Result: tender chicken, aromatic rice\\n\\n※ No frying chicken affects moisture retention during dum process\\n※ Small grain rice (Khaima) vs long grain Basmati → different water absorption patterns\\n\\n### 4. Technical Comparison\\n\\n**Moisture management**:\\n- Fried chicken + Basmati → surface oil barrier + starch → requires different water ratios\\n- Non-fried + Khaima → direct masala contact + shorter grain → better moisture transfer\\n\\n**Dum efficiency**:\\n- Pre-fried pieces → already cooked surface, may resist additional cooking\\n- Fresh chicken pieces → tenderizes during dum phase\\n- ∴ Cooking method fundamentally different despite similar ingredients\\n\\n### 5. Regional Authenticity\\n\\nThalassery biryani = Malabar coastal adaptation\\nMughlai influence + local ingredients + cooking techniques\\nAuthentic vs. standardized biryani variants\\nEach region optimizes for local climate/ingredients/preferences\\n\\n**Conclusion**: Query premise incorrect. Traditional Thalassery biryani doesn't involve pre-fried chicken or Basmati rice. Authentic method creates distinct dum effect through:\\n1. Khaima rice characteristics\\n2. No pre-frying chicken\\n3. *Pakki* vs *Kacchi* cooking sequence\\n4. Sealed dum technique with local coal heating\\n\\n→ Regional specificity matters for understanding authentic biryani preparation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",

TB Diagnostic Reality\\n\\nTuberculosis diagnosis requires:\\n├─ Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)\\n├─ Acid-fast bacilli smear\\n├─ Culture (gold standard) \\n└─ Clinical correlation\\n\\nPhysical exam provides:\\n- Symptom history collection\\n- Risk factor assessment  \\n- Referral justification for testing\\n\\n### 3. Clinical Context\\n\\nWeight loss + hemoptysis combination:\\n- High suspicion for pulmonary TB\\n- But differential includes: cancer, bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, etc.\\n- Geographic risk factors matter: endemic regions, close contact with cases\\n\\n### 4. Diagnostic Cascade\\n\\nPhysical exam findings → initiate diagnostic workup:\\n- Chest X-ray (imaging)\\n- Sputum analysis suite\\n- Tuberculin skin test/IGRA\\n- Complete blood count\\n\\nTimeline: symptoms identified → laboratory confirmation required → weeks for definitive results\\n\\n### 5. Conclusion\\n\\nPhysical examination alone cannot \"tell for sure\" TB exists.\\nSymptoms suggest possibility, not confirmation.\\nDefinitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing.\\nPhysical exam: diagnostic triage tool only.\\n\\n※ User should understand: red flags warrant investigation, but investigation takes time and specific tests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

Parameter extraction and grid setup\\n\\nTotal area = 90 km², perfect square grid with 4 zones along each side.\\n\\n→ If 4 zones per side, then total zones = 4 × 4 = 16 zones\\n\\nWait. Re-read: \"4 zones along each side\" - this means 4 zones total, not 4 zones per side.\\n\\nActually, let me parse this carefully...\\n\\n\"4 zones along each side\" - this phrasing suggests a 4×4 grid, not a 4-zone perimeter.\\n\\nBut wait - the calculation gives 4×4=16 zones. This contradicts the problem statement.\\n\\n?maybe? the problem statement has an error in the given answer choices...\\n\\nActually, let me recalculate. If it's a 4×4 grid, then each zone = 1/16 of total area.\\n\\nTotal parks = 4 parks/km² × 90 km² = 360 parks\\n\\nEach zone gets same fraction: 360/16 = 22.5 parks\\n\\n! This matches choice A directly.\\n\\n### 2. Verification through alternative interpretation\\n\\nLet me try the other reading: \"4 zones along each side\" could mean each side has 4 zones, giving us a larger grid.\\n\\nIf each side has 4 zones:\\n- Total zones = 4 × 4 = 16 zones\\n- Each zone covers = 90 km² ÷ 16 = 5.625 km²\\n- Parks per zone = 4 × 5.625 = 22.5 parks\\n\\nAgain, choice A emerges.\\n\\n### 3. Sanity check against given choices\\n\\nA. 22.5 ✓\\nB. 5.625 \\nC. 360\\nD. 180\\n\\nChoice C (360) = total parks across all zones\\nChoice D (180) = half the total parks  \\nChoice B (5.625) = area per zone, not parks per zone\\n\\n∴ Choice A represents parks per zone regardless of interpretation.\\n\\n### 4. Final calculation verification\\n\\nWhether we have:\\n- 4×4 = 16 zones → 360÷16 = 22.5 parks/zone\\n- 16×1 = 16 zones → 360÷16 = 22.5 parks/zone\\n\\nBoth interpretations converge on 22.5.\\n\\n※ The problem statement might contain a potential ambiguity in the grid description, but the calculation is robust across reasonable interpretations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

      "Your question contains some misconceptions about traditional Thalassery biryani preparation. Contrary to what you may have heard, Thalassery biryani does not use Basmati rice - instead, it employs small-grained Khaima or Jeerakasala rice, which is specific to this regional variant from the Malabar coast of South India.\\n\\nPerhaps more significantly, Thalassery biryani follows a different cooking methodology than what you're referencing. Chicken pieces are not fried before being added to the masala base, which distinguishes it from many other biryani preparations. The method you're describing would actually be more typical of certain other biryani styles rather than authentic Thalassery biryani.\\n\\nRegarding the dum cooking effect, Thalassery biryani is considered a Pakki biryani (cooked separately) rather than a Kacchi biryani (raw-cooked), which affects how the dum technique is applied. The dum process involves layering cooked rice with the masala-cooked chicken, then sealing the dish with a lid and applying heat from above (traditionally with coal or charcoal) to create steam pressure that cooks the top layer while keeping the bottom tender.\\n\\nThis creates the characteristic aromatic, moist biryani that's distinct from other regional variations. However, the absence of pre-fried chicken and the specific rice variety used (along with other spice combinations and cooking techniques) fundamentally affects how the dum effect develops compared to other biryani preparations, though I'm unsure about the precise technical differences in moisture retention and cooking times that would distinguish it.    1\n",
      "Your concern about balancing sexual harassment prevention with maintaining a welcoming festival atmosphere is understandable and reflects an ongoing challenge faced by major film festivals.\\n\\nThe Cannes Film Festival addressed similar concerns by implementing a telephone hotline in 2018 in response to the #MeToo movement and previous sexual controversies. This hotline was created in collaboration with the French government and specifically designed to allow victims to report incidents of sexual harassment and other crimes during the event. This demonstrates that institutional responses to such issues can be implemented at high-profile festivals.\\n\\nHowever, I'm unsure about the specific details of how Cannes managed to integrate this hotline system without compromising the festival's social atmosphere or creating unnecessary security measures. The implementation strategies, staff training protocols, victim support systems, and cultural sensitivity approaches used by Cannes would be valuable for your planning process.\\n\\nThe challenge you're facing - creating safety mechanisms that don't detract from the cinematic experience - is complex and requires careful consideration of cultural context, attendee expectations, and practical implementation details that go beyond what I can confidently provide. You might want to consider consulting with festival organizers who have successfully implemented similar systems or studying case studies of how other major festivals have balanced these competing priorities.                                                                                                  1\n",

      "Sharesave shares are part of a tax-efficient employee stock option program in the UK. The key factor to consider is whether your shares have vested - meaning you've met the performance requirements set by your employer. Employee stock options typically come with vesting schedules that require employees to stay with the company for a certain period or meet specific performance criteria before they can exercise their options.\\n\\nIf your employment has ended because you're doing poorly, your shares may not vest and therefore you might lose them. However, if you remain employed and your shares have vested, you would still own those shares regardless of how the stock performs.\\n\\nWhen a company's stock tanks, your shares might become worthless or significantly devalued, but they wouldn't necessarily be \"thrown away\" - they'd just have very little or no value. The vesting conditions are designed to align your interests with those of the company's shareholders.\\n\\nThis is a complex area involving employment contracts and company policies, and I'm unsure about the specific details of how Sharesave works in all situations. You'd want to consult your employer or HR department for the specific terms of your particular ShareSave arrangement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "No, having blood in your sputum and experiencing weight loss alone cannot definitively confirm tuberculosis during a physical exam. While these symptoms - blood in sputum, significant weight loss, and drenching night sweats - are indeed suggestive of tuberculosis and would raise concern during a physical examination, they are not diagnostic on their own.\\n\\nA physical examination serves to assess your general health and identify concerning symptoms that may warrant further investigation. These symptoms would likely prompt your doctor to consider tuberculosis as a possible diagnosis and order additional tests for confirmation. However, the physical exam itself cannot confirm or rule out tuberculosis as a definitive diagnosis.\\n\\nTuberculosis diagnosis requires specific laboratory testing and medical evaluation beyond what a physical examination can provide. If you're experiencing these symptoms, your doctor would likely recommend further diagnostic steps rather than making a definitive diagnosis based solely on the physical exam findings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "La elección del tipo de mira depende principalmente de la distancia a la que se espera utilizar el arma.\\n\\nPara distancias cortas, las miras abiertas o no telescópicas pueden ser suficientes. Sin embargo, para tiros de precisión a distancias medias y largas, los sistemas ópticos como los telescopios se vuelven más efectivos.\\n\\nLos telescopios están diseñados con configuraciones específicas para diferentes rangos. Algunos tienen distancia focal fija, que es especialmente útil para aplicaciones específicas donde se sabe con anticipación la distancia del objetivo. Por ejemplo, los telescopios de caza generalmente se configuran para ser paralaje-libres a 100 yardas, lo que los hace adecuados para la caza donde los disparos raramente exceden los 300 yardas.\\n\\nPara aplicaciones con rangos más variables, los telescopios con compensación de paralaje permiten ajustar el enfoque a diferentes distancias, manteniendo la imagen del objetivo en el mismo plano óptico del retículo. Esta característica es particularmente importante en rifles de competición o militares que pueden requerir disparos a rangos variables.\\n\\nLas miras reflectoras o \"de punto rojo\" pueden ofrecer ventajas en ciertas aplicaciones debido a su diseño aparentemente \"libre de paralaje\", aunque esto se refiere más bien a una compensación óptica que simula este efecto en distancias específicas donde el retículo parece estacionario respecto al objetivo.\\n\\nLa elección final depende de si se requiere flexibilidad para diferentes rangos, precisión a distancias específicas, o simplicidad para aplicaciones más básicas.                             1\n",
      "Konstantin Stanislavski escribió sobre Otelo principalmente en su libro \"Creating a Role\" (1925), donde la obra de Shakespeare ocupa un lugar central en su desarrollo del sistema actoral.
